# EfBulk
Ef Core (5.0) bulk insert, update, delete

I try to use a third-party class library:
 1. zzzprojects/EntityFramework-Extensions (charges)
 2. EntityFramework.Extended (free, only MsSql) 

Finally, I tried to solve the problem myself.

How I implement it: "Merge into a single SQL".(It passed the test on mysql 8.0.24.)
